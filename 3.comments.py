# this is a single line comment, python does not have multi line comments
print("hello world.")  # Comments can be here also, it prints hello world.

# Multi line comments can be
# used this way or use the string literals
# by ''' start and end ''', comments are ignored but added to make
# code more readable, or for explaining the code etc.

    Hello This Is A String But Python Reads It But Ignores
    It Because It Is Not Associated With Any Of The Varibale,
    You Can Use This For Multi Line Comments but not quite as intended.

#print("code can also be commented to prevent from executing.")
print("Thank You. Prashanth")
